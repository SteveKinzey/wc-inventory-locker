Lock WooCommerce stock as soon as a product is added to the cart to prevent overselling. Ideal for limited inventory or high-demand launches.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Inventory Locker** prevents overselling by reserving product stock the moment it's added to the cart. This plugin is ideal for high-traffic sales, limited edition drops, and scarcity-driven eCommerce.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/wc-inventory-locker`, or install through the WordPress admin.
2. Activate through the 'Plugins' menu.

Not in this version. Future versions may include customization.
